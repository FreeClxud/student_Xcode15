/*:
## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let userName = "FreeClxud"
var userAge = 30
var numberOfStepsTakenToday = 5000
let goalNumberOfSteps = 10000
var averageHeartRate = 72

/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
 let userName = "FreeClxud"
print("User  name is a constant because it typically does not change.")

var userAge = 30
print("User  age is a variable because it changes as time passes.")

var numberOfStepsTakenToday = 5000
print("Number of steps taken today is a variable because it can change throughout the day.")

let goalNumberOfSteps = 10000
print("Goal number of steps is a constant because it is usually set once per day.")

var averageHeartRate = 72
print("Average heart rate is a variable because it can fluctuate throughout the day.")
